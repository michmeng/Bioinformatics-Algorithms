# Bioinformatics-Algorithms
This repository contains different algorithms to solve practical challenges in modern biology.

Motivation
----------
What's so fascinating about the field of bioinformatics is the ability to take a complex biological problem and 
reimagine it as a solvable computational one. 

If you were given 2 genomes (each with billions of base pairs) and asked to find how these two samples 
were related, it would be a seemingly daunting task. But here's where bioinformatics comes to the rescue! 
Bioinformatics offers us a way to manipulate the problem into a problem synonymous to the Longest Common Subsequences problem, 
which we (should) know how to solve (using dynamic programming)! Bioinformatics techniques like this, allow us to answer 
remarkable questions of modern biology.

See below which a few of the complex biological problems that can be solved doing this!

What it does
------------
Here we try to solve a few complex biological problems: 
- [x] Assembling the Genome
- [x] Aligning Genomic Sequences
- [x] Finding Genomic Breakpoints
- [x] Finding Motifs 
- [x] Locating Mutations
- [x] Locating Sequences within the Genome
